class Improper(Connection):
    """A 4-partner connection between sites.

    This is a subclass of the gmso.Connection superclass.
    This class has strictly 4 members in its connection_members.
    The connection_type in this class corresponds to gmso.ImproperType
    The connectivity of an improper is:

    Parameters
    --------
    connection_members: list of gmso.Site
        4 sites of a improper. Central site first, then three
